A website made with Vite React to design a game where you drag a horse from on a square on a chessboard to another in the minimum number of moves. A Javascript program runs in background using Djikstra's algorithm to simulate a shortest distance path with the same starting and ending points. The computer results are shown along with the user's for comparison after the game ends.
